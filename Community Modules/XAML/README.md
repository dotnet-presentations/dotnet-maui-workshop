# .NET MAUI - Workshop: Focus on XAML

Today, we will take the app you created in the [.NET MAUI Workshop](https://github.com/dotnet-presentations/dotnet-maui-workshop) and focus on improving the XAML.

While the XAML you created as part of that workshop is functional, there are many opportunities to improve the XAML that it uses.

Many people criticize XAML as being verbose and hard to maintain. By completing this workshop, you'll see how that doesn't have to be the case and that it is possible to create XAML that is easy to write, read, understand, and maintain.

## Setup

This workshop is a direct follow-up to the [.NET MAUI Workshop](https://github.com/dotnet-presentations/dotnet-maui-workshop). After you've completed that workshop, you'll be all set to do this one.  
Or jump in using the  [Finished version](https://github.com/dotnet-presentations/dotnet-maui-workshop/Finish).

# .NET MAUI - Workshop

Today we will build a [Xamarin.Forms](https://docs.microsoft.com/xamarin?WT.mc_id=docs-workshop-jamont) application that will display a list of Monkeys from around the world. We will start by building the business logic backend that pulls down json-ecoded data from a RESTful endpoint. We will then leverage [Xamarin.Essentials](https://docs.microsoft.com/xamarin/essentials/index?WT.mc_id=docs-workshop-jamont) to find the closest monkey to us and also show the monkey on a map.

## Setup Guide
Hey there! This workshop will be a hands on and a bring your own device workshop. You can develop on PC or Mac and all you will need to do is install Visual Studio 2019 or 2022 or Visual Studio for Mac 2019 with the Xamarin workload.

Follow our simple [setup guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/xamarin/get-started/installation/index?WT.mc_id=docs-workshop-jamont) to ensure you have Visual Studio 2019 or 2022 and Xamarin setup and ready to deploy.

Before the conference I recommend going through the quick 10 minute [Xamarin Tutorial](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/learn/xamarin/hello-world-tutorial/intro?WT.mc_id=docs-workshop-jamont) that will guide you through installation and also ensuring everything is configured correct.

If you are new to mobile development, we recommend deploying to a physical Android device which can be setup in just a few steps. If you don't have a device, don't worry as you can setup an [Android emulator with hardware acceleration](https://docs.microsoft.com/xamarin/android/get-started/installation/android-emulator?WT.mc_id=docs-workshop-jamont). If you don't have time to set this up ahead of time, don't worry as we are here to help during the workshop.

Beyond that you will be good to go for the workshop! If you have some spare time we have prepared a full Xamarin 101 series to cover the basics of mobile development with .NET.

I have also put together an abstract of what you can expect for the day long workshop:

*	30 Min Session - Introduction to Xamarin Session & Setup Help
*	Single Page List of Data
*	MVVM & Data Binding
*	Navigation
*	Platform Specific Optimizations
*	Application Resources
